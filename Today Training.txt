Version Control 

Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
"Push" your changes to your main branch
Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
"Pull" the changes to your local machine
Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
"Merge" your branch to the main branch

Purpose
Manage projects with Git Repositories - files system is saved --Local    (server) remote/source
Clone a project to work on a local copy
Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
Push local updates to the main project

How it works
Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
You select the modified files you want to Stage
The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
You can revert back to any previous commit.
Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track
 of changes made in each commit!
 
GIT - Use case
Over 70% of developers use Git!
Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
Developers can see the full history of the project.
Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
